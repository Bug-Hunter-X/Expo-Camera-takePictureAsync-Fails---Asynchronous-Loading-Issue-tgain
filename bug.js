This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has finished loading.  This can happen if you call `takePictureAsync` immediately within the `onCameraReady` callback or before the camera component is fully mounted. The error message may vary, but it often involves `Camera` being undefined or a promise rejection indicating a failure to capture the image.
