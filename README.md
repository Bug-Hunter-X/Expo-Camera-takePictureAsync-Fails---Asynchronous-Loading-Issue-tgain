# Expo Camera takePictureAsync Failure: Asynchronous Loading

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Expo Camera API: calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera has fully loaded.  The solution involves properly handling the asynchronous nature of the camera component's loading process.

## Problem

Attempting to capture an image using `takePictureAsync` immediately after the camera is ready, or before the camera component has completely mounted, results in errors. The camera might be undefined, or a promise rejection might occur.

## Solution

The solution uses `useState` to track the camera's readiness and only calls `takePictureAsync` after the camera is confirmed to be loaded. This ensures that the camera API methods are accessed at the correct time.  The example also includes error handling for scenarios where camera access is denied or other issues arise.
